# EARLY DEV: neorg-auto-cats
A small neorg plugin to automatically inject metadata that adds directory structure as categories

- Adding categories to new files works 
- Updating is bugged, i set 3 lines of categories rather then properly updating 

I think i will clean this up over the week and fix the issue on updating but then this should be good to go.
